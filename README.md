# Parking-Slot-Checker
In this project, I created a Parking Slot Checker. That find how many total cars are present and how many spaces are vacant to park. The best thing about this project is using basic Image Processing techniques to solve the problem.

Creating a parking slot checking system using computer vision involves using image processing and machine learning techniques to detect and monitor available parking spaces. Here's a simplified step-by-step approach I used:
        
### 1. Data Collection:
  - **Image Dataset:** Gather images or video footage of the parking lot(s) where you want to implement the system. Capture various scenarios with different lighting conditions, weather, and vehicle types.
        
### 2. Annotation and Preprocessing:
  - **Annotation:** Manually label the images to mark vacant and occupied parking slots.
  - **Preprocessing:** Resize, crop, and augment the images to create a balanced dataset. This step enhances the model's ability to generalize.

### 3. Model Selection and Training:
  - **Choose Model Architecture:** Select a suitable pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN) for object detection.
  - **Transfer Learning:** Fine-tune the pre-trained model on your annotated parking slot dataset to recognize empty and occupied spots.
        
### 4. Implementation:
  - **Real-time Detection:** Use the trained model to detect and classify parking spots in real-time from video feeds or images.
  - **Interface Development:** Create a user interface to display the status of parking spots (occupied or vacant) to users.

### 5. Deployment:
  - **System Integration:** Integrate the detection system with cameras in the parking lot.
  - **Application Development:** Develop a user-facing application/web interface for users to check parking availability.
        
### Tools and Technologies:
   - **Python Libraries:** OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning tasks.
   - **Frameworks:** Use Flask/Django for web application development.
   - **Hardware:** Cameras for capturing live feeds.
        
### Challenges:
  - **Variability:** Lighting changes, occlusions, and varying vehicle sizes can affect accuracy.
  - **Real-time Processing:** Ensuring the system can process data quickly for live feeds.
  - **Dataset Quality:** Annotating a comprehensive dataset for accurate training.
        
### Conclusion:
The project involves training a model to detect empty and occupied parking slots, integrating it with live camera feeds, and creating a user-friendly interface to display parking availability. It requires careful data curation, model training, and system integration to provide accurate real-time information to users.
